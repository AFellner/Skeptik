Skeptik is a collection of data structures and algorithms focused especially on the compression of formal proofs. 

Resolution proofs, in particular, are used by various sat-solvers, smt-solvers and automated theorem provers, as certificates of correctness for the answers they provide. These automated deduction tools have a wide range of application areas, from mathematics to software and hardware verification.

By providing smaller resolution proofs that are easier and faster to check, Skeptik aims at improving the reliability of these automated deduction tools and at facilitating the exchange of information between them.


###Usage Instructions###

You must have [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) (version >= 0.12.1) installed. 
Then go to Skeptik's root directory using the terminal and simply execute:

```
  export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

  sbt
  
  compress
```

(you may increase the value after -Xmx, if you need or want to provide more memory to the JVM)

Further instructions, such as necessary command-line arguments, will be shown to you.

If you face any difficulty, do not hesitate to contact us.



###Usage Example###

The following command will run the proof compression algorithm 'RecyclePivotsWithIntersection' on the proof 'eq_diamond8.smt2' (written in VeriT's proof format) and write the compressed proof in 'output.skeptik' (using Skeptik's proof format):

```
  sbt 
  
  compress examples/proofs/VeriT/eq_diamond8.smt2 -a RPI -o output.skeptik
```



###Importing Skeptik###

To import Skeptik as a library in your own Java or Scala projects, 
add the following line to your build.sbt file, if you are using [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) to manage your library dependencies:

```
   libraryDependencies += "at.logic" %% "skeptik" % "1.0"
```

or add the following lines to your pom.xml file, if you are using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) instead:

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>at.logic</groupId>
            <artifactId>skeptik_2.10</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
```

###Development Policy###

Developers are encouraged to:
 
 1. fork from [Paradoxika/Skeptik](https://github.com/Paradoxika/Skeptik), 
 2. program according to the [usual Scala style conventions](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/),
 3. follow the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model in their own forks, 
 4. make pull requests when they have finished a feature or hotfix branch.

Using the git flow model can be easier with the [gitflow extension for git](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).



###Documentation###

Detailed theoretical descriptions of some of the algorithms implemented in Skeptik are available in our [papers](https://github.com/Paradoxika/Skeptik/tree/develop/doc/papers). There are also [slides](https://github.com/Paradoxika/Skeptik/tree/develop/doc/slides) of presentations about Skeptik.

Scaladoc documentation for the code can be generated by running the following command:

```
  sbt doc
```
