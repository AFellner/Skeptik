{"name":"Skeptik","body":"Skeptik is a collection of data structures and algorithms focused especially on the compression of formal proofs. \r\n\r\nResolution proofs, in particular, are used by various sat-solvers, smt-solvers and first-order theorem provers, as certificates of correctness for the answers they provide.\r\nThese automated deduction tools have a wide range of application areas, from mathematics to software and hardware verification.\r\n\r\nBy providing smaller resolution proofs that are easier and faster to check, Skeptik aims at improving the reliability of these automated deduction tools and at facilitating the exchange of information between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Usage Instructions###\r\n\r\nYou must have [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) installed. \r\nThen go to Skeptik's root directory using the terminal and simply execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  sbt run\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther instructions, such as necessary command-line arguments, will be shown to you.\r\nIf you face any difficulty, do not hesitate to contact us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Stats###\r\n\r\n* [![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/Paradoxika/job/Skeptik/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/Paradoxika/job/Skeptik/)\r\n* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/Skeptik)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n * Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo (@Ceilican)\r\n * Joseph Boudou (@Jogo27)\r\n\r\n### Mailinglists\r\n\r\n * skeptik-dev@googlegroups.com - for Skeptik's developers","tagline":"A library for proof theory (especially focused on proof compression) in Scala.","note":"Don't delete this file!
