#Skeptik#

Skeptik is a collection of data structures and algorithms focused on the compression of formal proofs, especially propositional resolution proofs. 

Resolution proofs are used by various sat-solvers, smt-solvers and first-order theorem provers, as certificates of correctness for the answers they provide.
These automated deduction tools have a wide range of application areas, from mathematics to software and hardware verification.

By providing smaller resolution proofs that are easier and faster to check, Skeptik aims at improving the reliability of these automated deduction tools and at facilitating the exchange of information between them.
